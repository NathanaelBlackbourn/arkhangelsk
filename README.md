# Plot
2045, Gertrud Rask Land, Greenland.

A huge explosion occurs at a mining operation within the arctic circle. The cause of the explosion is unknown. The player and their team of three scientists are sent to investigate.

# Gameplay
The crater is a text based adventure game. It is played by entering predetermined commands into a text field. Each scene is described in a text box on the screen and available commands are communicated to the player in the text. The game is both winnable and losable. 

The number of moves the player can make is limited as the temperture ticks down with each move and as soon as it hits minimum at fifty the player loses.

Food is also a limited resource for the player which ticks down each game day. Food, however, can be restored at one scene in the game.
